# Countdown-Timer

Countdown timer helps to track the time taken for each lap. The timer goes into -ve time count if the lap is not completed in given time. This helps to know how much overflow time taken to complete a lap. The maximum of 5 laps are allowed and the last lap is always stored in the browser localstorage.

# How to use

The widget is developed using native javascript. So, we don't have any dependency to load, which makes it faster and easier to use. 

Below are the user stories as per my understanding:
1. Enter the timer value in hrs, min, sec and click on start button. If the user wants to reset all the value click on reset button.
2. Onces the user starts the timer, user have stop, pause and resume button. Pause button will halts the timer and resume continues.
3. Stop will reset the timer and present the laps. This can also be achieved by pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
4. When user is trying to edit the timer and instead of pressing "backspace" user pressed "space bar" then we are picking the last timer value and displaying.
