# Countdown-Timer

Countdown timer helps to track the time taken for each lap. The timer goes into -ve time count if the lap is not completed in given time. This helps to know how much overflow time taken to complete a lap. A maximum of 5 laps are allowed and the last lap is always stored in the browser localstorage.

# How to use

The widget is developed in native javascript and hence we have no dependencies making it faster to use. 

Below are the user stories as per my understanding:
1. Enter the timer value in hrs, min, sec and click on start button. User can reset the timer by clicking on reset button.
2. Onces the user starts the timer, user has stop, pause and resume buttons. Pause button will halt the timer and resume continues.
3. Stop will reset the timer and present the laps. This can also be achieved by pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
4. When user is trying to edit the timer and instead of pressing "backspace" user pressed "space bar" then we are picking the last timer value and displaying.
